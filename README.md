# Thought Leader Wishlist

This is a fork of https://github.com/rslifka/wishlist, specifically to capture
what the Destiny 2 YouTube community considers a good roll, rather than my
own personal opinions. Now that DIM allows you to have multiple wishlists
imported into it, I think a base "here's what these folks have to say" list
combined with a "here's my own personal rolls" list makes a lot of sense, and
they don't have to be in one list anymore! This means that anyone can take
these rolls and import them into their own wishlists if they want to.

You can view all of the rolls here: [https://steveklabnik.github.io/thought-leader-wishlist/](https://steveklabnik.github.io/thought-leader-wishlist/)

You can import the list into DIM via this URL:
